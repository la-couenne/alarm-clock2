Special ringing alarm clock for those who have trouble in the morning

Hello everyone! Here is version 2 of my alarm clock to help those who systematically go there in the morning. The principle is quite simple, rather than being suddenly awakened by a ringtone or music, looking at the time, telling yourself that you have 10 minutes left and falling back into a deep sleep without hearing anything, this alarm clock does not no gift. :

it emits 1 single beep for 2 seconds then nothing for 1 minute. It will emit 10 beeps (1 per min) then nothing!

The detail that in my opinion makes all the difference is that during these 10 minutes it is impossible to display the time. So you wake up thinking "not now" and wait for the next beep, you can even go back to sleep without worry. After a while, since you can no longer display the time, and you do not know how many beeps there were, lest the 10s have passed and you do not darken deeply, you get up without difficulty because you have no other option :D

I think it takes a short week for the brain to learn to respond to beeps, but overall it works well for me. Don't hesitate to give it a try and get back to me :)
